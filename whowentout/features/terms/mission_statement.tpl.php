    <p>Welcome,</p>

    <p>We are proud to present you with WhoWentOut.com, a novel website that not only gives GW and Georgetown students the best deals for the best venues in Washington DC but ALSO connects people before and after their night out.</p>

    <p>Ever get tired of the event page on Facebook? From fundraising events to club promoters piling up on your event page, we started looking for a more systematic and practical way of seeing whatâ€™s REALLY going on at night. WhoWentOut is our answer.</p>

    <p>We are a place where you can come and see where ALL of your friends are going on any given night with just one glance. Is it a club, bar or an on campus kind of night? Let us help you decide.</p>

    <p>We have several new ideas of how we can make our site bigger, better and more useful for all of our users. So please, stay tuned for updates and while you wait:</p>

    <p>Build your entourage, check into a venue, get the best deals sent right to your phone or create your own event and invite all of your friends!</p>

    <p>Where are YOU going tonight?</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>The WhoWentOut Team</p>
