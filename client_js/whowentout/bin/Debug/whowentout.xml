        <member name="F:PusherApi.ConnectionState.Initialized">
            <summary>
            Initial state. No event is emitted in this state.
            </summary>

        <member name="F:PusherApi.ConnectionState.Connecting">
            <summary>
            All dependencies have been loaded and Pusher is trying to connect.
            The connection will also enter this state when it is trying to reconnect after a connection failure.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:PusherApi.ConnectionState.Connected">
            <summary>
            The connection to Pusher is open and authenticated with your app.

        <member name="F:PusherApi.ConnectionState.Unavailable">
            <summary>
            The connection is temporarily unavailable. In most cases this means
            that there is no internet connection. It could also mean that Pusher is down,
            or some intermediary is blocking the connection. In this state, Pusher will 
            automatically retry the connection every ten seconds.
            </summary>

        <member name="F:PusherApi.ConnectionState.Failed">
            <summary>
            Pusher is not supported by the browser. This implies that Flash is not available, 
            since that is the only fallback in browsers that do not natively support WebSockets.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:PusherApi.ConnectionState.Disconnected">
            <summary>
            The Pusher connection was previously connected and has now intentionally been closed.

        <member name="P:whowentout.lib.JobQueue.Count">
            <summary>

            The job currently being executed is not included.
